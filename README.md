## 1- Image Augmentation with OpenCV
Data augmentation is a strategy that significantly increases the diversity of data available for 
training deep learning models, without collecting new data. Several images are created of same 
image by various transformations such as flipping, rotating, sharpening, cropping, etc.
Create a new notebook and to install OpenCV, you can type:
```
!pip install opencv-python
```
