## LAB1 :IMAGE-AUGMENTATION-PREPARARTION
## 1- Image Augmentation with OpenCV
Data augmentation is a strategy that significantly increases the diversity of data available for 
training deep learning models, without collecting new data. Several images are created of same 
image by various transformations such as flipping, rotating, sharpening, cropping, etc.

Installation and Setup
```
!pip install opencv-python
```
To import the OpenCV library to enable computer vision
```
import cv2
```
 Image Preparation and Augmentation for Deep Learning with Kera

## 2- Image Preparation and Augmentation for Deep Learning with Keras
Keras is an open-source high-level Neural Network library, written in Python and running on 
top of the machine learning platform.
<br>
Installation and Setup
Being the fact that Keras runs on the top of Tensorflow, we need to install TensorFlow first.
```
# Requires the latest pip
!pip install --upgrade pip
```
```
# Current stable releaseâ€™s Tensorflow for CPU and GPU
!pip install tensorflow
```
```
# Install Keras
!pip install keras
```
